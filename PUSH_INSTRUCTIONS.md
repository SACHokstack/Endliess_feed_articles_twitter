# Push to GitHub - Instructions

## Current Status: ✅ Ready to Push

Your Spine News Aggregation System is fully prepared and committed to git. All changes have been made and the repository is ready for deployment.


### Option 1: Use Personal Access Token (Recommended)
```bash
# Remove current remote and add with token
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/SACHokstack/Endliess_feed_articles_twitter.git

# When prompted for password, use your personal access token instead
git push -u origin main
```

**To create a Personal Access Token:**
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
4. Copy the token and use it as your password

### Option 2: SSH Authentication
```bash
# Set up SSH key (if not already done)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add SSH key to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy output and add to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys

# Change remote to SSH
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:SACHokstack/Endliess_feed_articles_twitter.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: Manual Upload
If authentication continues to fail:
1. Create the repository on GitHub first
2. Use GitHub Desktop or upload files manually through the web interface
