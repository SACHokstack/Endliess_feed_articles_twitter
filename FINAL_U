## Troubleshooting on Your Laptop

### If you get "python: command not found"
Use `python3` instead:
```bash
python3 standalone_upload.py --dry-run
```

### If you get MongoDB connection errors
1. Check your internet connection
2. Make sure your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
3. Verify the connection string is correct

### If no media files are found
- Ensure you're in the directory that contains `twitter-scraper/`
- Make sure your media files are in `twitter-scraper/*/media_tweets/` directories

## After Successful Upload

✅ All your media files will be stored in MongoDB GridFS
✅ Your web app will automatically serve them from the cloud
✅ You can delete local media files to save space
✅ Your app will work on any cloud platform

## Files You Need on Your Laptop

Copy these files from your project to your laptop:
1. `standalone_upload.py` - The upload script
2. Your `twitter-scraper/` directory with all the media files

That's it! The script is completely self-contained and doesn't need any other project files.
