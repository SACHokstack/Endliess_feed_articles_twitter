I was asked about this.

The reason the president's leg tilts toward the inside can be a normal anatomical variant of his knee axis or a common uneven wear and tear of the knee joint/cartilage on one side (valgus knee).

This can be totally asymptomatic which basically means NTD https://t.co/6cUmoMEbgs
