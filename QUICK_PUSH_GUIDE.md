# Quick Push Guide - Updated with Correct Username

## ✅ Repository Ready to Push

Your repository is now configured with the correct username `sachokstack`. All changes are committed and ready to push.

## 🔐 Authentication Options

Since you got a 403 error, you'll need to authenticate properly:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
```bash
# Use your username sachokstack
git push -u origin main

# When prompted for username: sachokstack
# When prompted for password: use your GitHub Personal Access Token
```

### Option 2: Token in URL (Alternative)
```bash
# Set remote with token (replace YOUR_TOKEN with your personal access token)
git remote set-url origin https://sachokstack:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/sachokstack/Endliess_feed_articles_twitter.git

# Then push
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: SSH (If you have SSH keys set up)
```bash
# Change to SSH remote
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:sachokstack/Endliess_feed_articles_twitter.git

# Push via SSH
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔑 How to Create a Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
4. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again)
5. Use this token as your password when prompted
